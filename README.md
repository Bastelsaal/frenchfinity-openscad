## Issues and feature requests

If you have any issues or feature requests, please open an issue on
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bastelsaal/frenchfinity-openscad/issues).
I also welcome pull requests if you want to contribute to the project.

## Filenames

Like in the original version of Frenchfinity the OpenSCAD version also generates a log output containing a file name
proposal. Unfortunately it is not possible to set the export filename in OpenSCAD, so you have to rename the file
manually.

Just look for `ECHO: "filename proposal:"` in the code. Example:

```
ECHO: "filename proposal:", "frenchfinity_wall_anchor_v1scad_w100_h60_d20.stl"
```

This log output is generated by `hintFileName` in `labels.scad`.
